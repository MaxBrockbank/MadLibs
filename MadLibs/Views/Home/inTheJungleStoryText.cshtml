<h1>In The Jungle</h1>
<p>I walk through the color jungle. I take out my
@Model.Adjective1 canteen. There's a
@Model.Adjective2 parrot with a @Model.Adjective3
@Model.Noun1 in his mouth right there in front
of me in the @Model.Adjective4 trees! I gaze at his
@Model.Adjective5 @Model.Noun2. A sudden
sound awakes me from my daydream! A panther’s
@Model.Verb1 in front of my head! I
@Model.Verb2 his @Model.Adjective6
breath. I remember I have a packet of @Model.Noun3
that makes go into a deep slumber! I
@Model.Verb3 it away from me in front of the
@Model.Noun4 . Yes he's eating it! I
@Model.Verb4 away through the
@Model.Adjective7 jungle. I meet my parents at the
tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle. </p>
